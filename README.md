# OpenXortex

**Youtube Demo** : 
N/A

**Purpose**:
The main purpose of this project is to learn how to develop a game in Unity3D from scatch. When I got a htc vive, the first game to blow me away in VR was Xortex mini games insideValve's "The Lab". I totally loved the concept of an old style 2D space shooter remade in a VR environment. So after completing an online course about the ins and outs of unity, I decided that my first game attempt would be something like Xortex since I felt like it's something within range of my limited experience in game development.

So this project will hopefully be the first step for me to transition from regular software development and into game development and beyond.

**Planned Features**:
  * Work on HTC Vive
  * Work on Android's Daydream VR Platform
